# peep_counting

The images used in this project are in an [external link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dwNBJFFELWqjHncG4zoBxuY25bLC_REl). The images folder should be extracted to a folder on parent level relative to the program. The final structure should be:

```
images/
    BG/
    CC/
    L1/
src/
    peep.py
    peep.ipynb
```
